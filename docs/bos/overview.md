Near components are small applications stored **entirely on-chain** that can easily be stacked to create full Web3 apps (think [Lido](tutorial/hello-lido.md), Uniswap, Aave).

Developers can fork these apps and [compose them](./components.md#composing-components) to create full web applications.

Components can call functions on any blockchain - with current support for all EVM chains (e.g. Polygon, zkSync) and NEAR - making it a flexible solution for developers working with different blockchains.
