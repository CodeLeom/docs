Hi! Let us guide you in starting and interacting with your first smart contract in NEAR: Hello NEAR Contract.

**Hello NEAR Contract** is a simple smart contract that stores and retrieves a greeting message. It uses two methods, `get_greeting` and `set_greeting`, as well as a temporary 
dev account to test out both methods.

---

## Create NEAR App
If you already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed, simply run:

```bash 
  npx create-near-app@latest
```

Use the interactive menu to set up your first project folder. For this guide we'll be using the `A Near Smart Contract` option.

Once the folder is ready, check the README. It will show you how to **build** and **deploy** the smart contract.

```bash 
  npm run build
  npm run deploy
```

Once the smart contract is deployed, you can set a new greeting using the provided temporary dev account found in `neardev/dev-account` or by using a testnet account. You can [sign up for a testnet account here](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/create). 

We go over how testnet accounts are used in more detail in [other guides](../3.tutorials/crosswords/03-intermediate/03-linkdrop.md), but for now all you need to know is that you can use your testnet account anywhere an account ID is needed without having to worry about any real-world costs.

## Structure of the project

Now that you've deployed your first contract, let us take a closer look to its structure:

1. The smart contract code is in the `/contract` folder.
2. The compiled smart contract can be found in `/build/<your_project_name>.wasm`.
3. The account's name in which the contract was deployed is in `/neardev/dev-account`.

### Contract
The contract presents 2 methods: `set_greeting` and `get_greeting`. The first one stores a `String` in the contract's parameter `message`, while the second one retrieves it. By default, the contract returns the message `"Hello"`.

## Testing

When writing smart contracts it is very important to test all methods exhaustively. This
project has **unit** tests. Before digging in their code, go ahead and execute them using the command `npm run test`.

### Unit test
Unit tests check individual functions in the smart contract. They are written in the
same language than the smart contract. If your contract is in Rust you will find the tests at the bottom of
each `.rs` file.

## Moving Forward

That's it for our first quickstart tutorial. You have now seen a fully functional contract and testing.

Go ahead and check other [examples](/tutorials/examples/guest-book) or proceed straight to the [Develop section](./contracts/anatomy.md) to know how to write your own contract.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate in joining us on [Discord](https://near.chat). We regularly host Office Hours, in which you can join our voice channel and ask questions.

Happy coding!
